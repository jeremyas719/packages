/**
* You work in an automated factory and your objective is to write the function that will dispatch the packages to the correct stack,
* according to their volume and mass.
* <p>
* - A package is <b>bulky</b> if its volume (Width x Height x Length) is greater than or equal to 1,000,000 cmÂ³ or when one of
* its dimension is greater or equal than 150 cm.
* - A package is <b>heavy</b> when its mass is greater or equal than 20 kg.
* <p>
* You must dispatch the packages in the following stacks.
* - STANDARD: standard packages (those which are not bulky nor heavy) can be handled normally.
* - SPECIAL: packages that are either heavy or bulky can't be handled automatically.
* - REJECTED: packages that are <b>both</b> heavy and bulky are rejected.
* <p>
* Implementation
* <p>
* Implement the function <code>solve(width, height, length, mass)</code> (units are centimeter for the dimensions and kilogram for the mass). 
* This function must return a string: the name of the stack where the package should go.
